# Word Scrambling                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                         
## INTRODUCTION                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                          
The project is to write a Python program that reads a text file, scrambles the words in the file on following rules and writes the output to a new text file:            
                                                                                                                                                                         
- Words less than or equal to 3 characters need not be scrambled                                                                                                         
- Don't scramble first and last char, so Scrambling can become Srbmnacilg or Srbmnailcg or Snmbracilg , i.e. letters except first and last can be scrambled in any order 
- Punctuation at the end of the word to be maintained as is i.e. "Surprising," could become "Spsirnirug," but not "Spsirn,irug"                                          
- Following punctuation marks are to be supported - Comma Question mark, Full stop, Semicolon, Exclamation                                                               
- Do this for a file and maintain sequences of lines                                                                                                                     
- On executing the program, it should prompt the user to enter input file name and generate an output file with scrambled text.                                          
- Output file should be named by appending the word "Scrambled" to input file name.                                                                                      


- The project provides a practice on following concepts to learners:                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                         
  - For loops                                                                                                                                                              
  - If-else statements                                                                                                                                                     
  - String                                                                                                                                                                 
  - Lists                                                                                                                                                                  
  - Functions
