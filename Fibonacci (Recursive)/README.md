# Fibonacci (Recursive)

## A program to print the Fibonacci series upto nth element.

### Fibonacci Series:
The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it:

* the 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1),
* the 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
* the 5 is (2+3),
* and so on!

### Recursion:

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. 
Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.
