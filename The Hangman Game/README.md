# Hangman Game

Hangman is a game where the player:
* Needs to guess the letters of the word.

* Gets limited number of turns.

* Gets to see the word as correctly guessed letter(s) is/are revealed.

## Words:
I just looked up common words in English and put them into a text file.
I wrote another script to take those words and put them into order.


Key Concepts to keep in mind for this Python Project:
* Random
* Variables
* Boolean
* Input and Output
* Integer
* Char
* String
* Length
* Print
